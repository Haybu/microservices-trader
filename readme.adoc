== Microservices Trader Application

This application is a Maven-ized replica of the open sourced https://github.com/pivotal-bank/cf-SpringBootTrader[trader application].

This version of the application leverages OAuth2 security feature. It authenticates and authorizes a user using Okta.

Service's configurations are sourced from a config server backed by properties files reside in
https://github.com/Haybu/cf-SpringBootTrader-config[github].

On this application repo, there are two branches. one to support legacy OAuth2 and another to demonstrate
next generation OAuth2 Client authentication in Spring 5. Each branch is supported by a corresponding config
repository branch.
